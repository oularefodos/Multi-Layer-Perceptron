## üîç Overview
This project implements:
- **Feedforward propagation**
- **Backpropagation with gradient descent**
- **Modular layer design** (customizable hidden layers)
- **Softmax activation** for probabilistic outputs
- **Binary cross-entropy loss** evaluation
- Learning curve visualization

Trained on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset** to classify tumors as benign/malignant.
